C++ Modules – 42 Curriculum

This repository contains the set of C++ Modules from the 42 (1337) curriculum, designed to introduce and progressively deepen understanding of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Each module (or "day") focuses on a specific concept, starting from the fundamentals of writing simple classes and objects, and advancing toward more complex topics such as inheritance, operator overloading, polymorphism, and working with standard containers.

📚 Project Overview

The C++ Modules are structured to build strong foundations in:

Procedural to Object-Oriented transition

Class design and encapsulation

Memory management

Inheritance and multiple inheritance

Operator overloading

Polymorphism and abstract classes

Interfaces

Exception handling

STL containers such as vector, list, and map

Each module includes practical exercises that reinforce theoretical concepts through implementation.

🎯 Learning Objectives

Through these modules, the goal is to:

Understand core C++ syntax and structure

Apply OOP principles in real-world scenarios

Write modular, maintainable, and reusable code

Master C++98 standard (as required by the curriculum)

Develop problem-solving skills using object-oriented design

🛠 Technologies & Standard

Language: C++

Standard: C++98

Compilation: c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror

🚀 How to Compile

Each module contains its own exercises and Makefile.
To compile a specific exercise:

make

Then run the executable:

./program_name
🧠 What This Project Represents

These C++ Modules mark the transition from C programming to modern object-oriented design. They serve as a foundation for more advanced projects such as networking, game engines, and large-scale systems development.
